### Introduction

In this video we go over an introduction to what Objects are and how we begin to
use Objects in Object Oriented Programming.


### Learning Goals

* Review of our use of objects thus far
* Justify the need for custom objects
* Create our object templates or "classes"
* Create **state** through instance variables
* Create **behavior** through instance methods

### Timestamps

* 00:00 - Introduction
* 00:55 - Some objects we have worked with, so far:
  - Fixnums

  - Hashes
* 02:55 - Why do we need custom classes?
* 04:38 - Building our own `Rectangle` class
* 07:00 - The **constructor**

* 11:22 - Inspecting the state which our `my_rectange` object stores in `pry`
* 12:47 - Exposing object state by defining behavior (a reader)
* 13:55 - The `attr_reader` method
* 16:00 - Adding the `perimeter` behavior to the `Rectangle` class
* 18:55 - Defining the `summary` method on `Rectangle`
* 20:22 - Calling instance variables vs. calling instance methods from within a class
* 21:48 - The `self` keyword
* 22:20 - Wrapping up the `Rectangle` class
* 24:28 - Revisiting the concept of **constructors** by creating a `Book` object
