# Capstone Project Ideas

<Your ideas, here>
**YouTube clone**

The first feature I want to start out with other than account creation is channel creation. There are going to be lots of models that follow CRUD. To name some, user creation, channel creation, videos, and comments. As for fancy features I was planning having ajax controll the CRUD functionality of the comments. I was also thinking about using actioncable to load comments on a video on the fly. I might do some line graphs to show views on the video. Something simple, views on the side and date on the bottom. Yeah this project aligns with my interests and hobbies. This idea has been brewing around my head for the past couple of weeks. Seeing as this is a youtube clone yes it can be made instal a web application with the rails framework.

**Social Media Site**

This idea came to me when I was researching actioncable the other day. I think the best feature to work on first would be profile editing system with some image uploads for a header/profile picture. Almost every feature that I'd put in this application would be CRUD. I think the fanciest feature I want to put in this application would be a live messaging system with actioncable or maybe some other websocket framework.
